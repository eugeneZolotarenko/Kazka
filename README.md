This site was created for kindergarten / primary school in Ukraine. I tried to make design interesting and unique and add some features with css animations. As menaging system I used Wordpress.<br/><br/>
I appreciate this project for expiriance, which I got. I discovered a lot of new things in css, html, jquery, Wordpress/php. Site has 5 different templates for categories of pages, each template has unique design and background-photo.
