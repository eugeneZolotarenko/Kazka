# Kazka

This site was created for kindergarten / primary school in Ukraine. I tried to make the design interesting and unique, and I have added some features with css animations. This web site is powered by Wordpress.<br/><br/>
I appreciate this project for the experience it gave me. I learned a lot of new things in css, html, jquery, Wordpress/php. This site has 5 different templates for categories of pages. Each template has a unique design and background photo.<br/><br/>
A lot of things I could make over in this project, if I created it now, but I had to make it so, to be able to make things better in the future.
